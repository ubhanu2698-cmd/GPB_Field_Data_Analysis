## Overview

The **GPB Field Data Analysis Shiny App** is an interactive web application designed for analyzing multi-environment wheat field trial data.  
It allows researchers and breeders to perform statistical analyses, including ANOVA, BLUP/BLUE estimation, and data visualization, across multiple environments, years, and replications.  

This app was developed using **R** and **Shiny** and is hosted online via **shinyapps.io** for easy access.

## Features

- Upload field trial datasets in **CSV** or **Excel** format  
- Perform **ANOVA** for multi-environment trials  
- Calculate **BLUPs and BLUEs** for genotypes  
- Visualize genotype performance across environments  
- Supports multiple years, environments, replications, and blocks  
- Sample dataset included for testing and demonstration
